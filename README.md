# ChaiONE Code Challenge

A simple webapp with some code challenges from ChaiONE.

## Usage

- Download, `bundle install`, add your GitHub credentials to `/.env`, then `foreman start`.
- Or simply visit http://whispering-anchorage-9375.herokuapp.com

## Notes

The GitHub Rockstars page is slower than I'd like it to be, but that can be improved later if needed.
